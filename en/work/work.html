			<h2>Work</h2>
			<h4>Computability</h4>
			<p>After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 
			1934 at King's College, Cambridge, from where he gained first-class 
			honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the young age of 22, he was elected 
			a fellow at King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved 
			the central limit theorem, despite the fact that he had failed to find 
			out that it had already been proved in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.
			</p>
			<p>In 1928, German mathematician David Hilbert had called attention 
			to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem). In his momentous paper 
			"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" 
			(submitted on 28 May 1936 and delivered 12 November), Turing reformulated Kurt 
			Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing 
			Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and 
			simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. He 
			proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable 
			mathematical computation if it were representable as analgorithm. He 
			went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by 
			first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: 
			in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given 
			Turing machine will ever halt. </p>
			<p>Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's 
			equivalent proof using his lambda calculus, Turing had been unaware 
			of Church's work. Turing's approach is considerably more accessible 
			and intuitive than Church's. It was also novel in its notion of a 'Universal 
			Machine' (now known as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that 
			such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine, 
			or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that 
			is computable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of 
			the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this 
			day a central object of study in theory of computation. </p>
			<p>From September 1936 to July 1938, he spent most of his time studying 
			under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical 
			work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an 
			electro-mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938, he obtained his 
			PhD from Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, introduced 
			the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where 
			Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing a study 
			of problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine. </p>
			<p>When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given by Ludwig 
			Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. The two argued and 
			disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding 
			his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but 
			rather invents them. He also started to work part-time with the Government 
			Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS). </p>
			<h4>Cryptanalysis</h4>
			<p>During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in 
			the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and 
			wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, 
			you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius." </p>
			<p>From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the GC&amp;CS, 
			the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis 
			of the Enigma, with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&amp;CS codebreaker. Soon after 
			the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided 
			the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and 
			their method of decrypting Enigma messages, Turing and Knox started 
			to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method 
			relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely 
			to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, 
			using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification 
			of the bombe (an improvement of the Polish Bomba). </p>
			<p>On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, 
			Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&amp;CS. Specifying 
			the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that 
			Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator 
			procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure 
			for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus; 
			developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels 
			of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) dubbed Turingery and, towards the end 
			of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope 
			Park that was codenamed Delilah. </p>
			<p>By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different 
			possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative 
			contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical 
			approaches which were entitled Report on the applications of probability 
			to cryptography and Paper on statistics of repetitions, which were of 
			such value to GC&amp;CS and its successor GCHQ, that they were not released 
			to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary 
			of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician said at the time that the fact that 
			the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their 
			importance. </p>
			<p>Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley 
			Park. He was known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on Enigma 
			was known as 'The Prof's Book'. Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked 
			with him, is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing: </p>
			<blockquote class="style_italic">
				In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of 
				hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas 
				mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain 
				would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended 
				he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would 
				get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another 
				of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator 
				pipes to prevent it being stolen.
			</blockquote>
			<p>While working at Bletchley, Turing, a talented long-distance runner, 
			occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for 
			high-level meetings, and he was capable of world-class marathon standards. Turing 
			tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an injury. 
			His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British 
			silver medalist Thomas Richards' olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. 
			He was the best runner for the Walton Athletic Club, discovered when 
			he passed the group while running alone. </p>
			<p>In 1945, Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime 
			services, but his work remained secret for many years. </p>

			<h4>Turing Machine</h4>
			<p>A <span class="style_bold">Turing machine</span> is a hypothetical 
			device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table 
			of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can be adapted to 
			simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and is particularly useful 
			in explaining the functions of a CPU inside a computer.</p>
