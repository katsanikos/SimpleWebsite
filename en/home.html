			<h2>Welcome to Alan Turing's webpage!</h2>
			<p>In this website you'll find information about Alan Turing, father 
			of Computer Science!</p>
			<h4>Father of Computer Science</h4>
			<p>Turing broke the German Navy, Airforce and Army Enigma codes and 
			handed the allies an advantage in the second world war, which are rightly 
			his most remembered and celebrated accomplishments. </p>
			<p>But he's also the father of computer science and he significantly 
			advanced the field of artificial intelligence, a phrase that hadn't 
			even been coined until after his death. In a time when the first general 
			purpose computers had just been built, Turing was already asking the 
			question 'can computers think'? </p>
			<p>It was that question that resulted in the Turing Test, which dictates 
			that a computer can only be truly intelligent, or said to 'think', if 
			a human interrogator can not tell it apart, through conversation, from 
			a human being. </p>
			<p>The Turing test is still considered a benchmark for charting the 
			progression of A.I, although some question whether or not it's still 
			relevant because no computer is has been able to score a passing mark.
			</p>
			<p>His brilliance was exhibited when he created a chess computer programme 
			for a computer that was yet to exist, when he then tried to install 
			it on an existing computer it simply failed. Fast forward some 48 years 
			to 1996 and you could imagine his joy if he'd been able to witness IBM's 
			Deep Blue chess computer beating world champion chess player, Gary Kasparov.
