			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was a British 
			mathematician,logician,cryptanalyst, philosopher, computer scientist, 
			mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner. He was 
			highly influential in the development of computer science, providing 
			a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with 
			the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general 
			purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father 
			of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
			</p>
			<p>During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code 
			and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain'scodebreaking centre. 
			For a time he led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval 
			cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, 
			including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, 
			anelectromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma 
			machine. Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest 
			contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. Turing's 
			pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages enabled the Allies 
			to defeat the Nazis in several crucial battles. </p>
			<p>After the war, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, 
			where he designed the ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program 
			computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Laboratory 
			at Manchester University, where he assisted development of the Manchester 
			computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He 
			wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis, and predicted oscillating chemical 
			reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first 
			observed in the 1960s. </p>
			<p>Turing was prosecuted for homosexuality in 1952, when such 
			acts were still criminalised in the UK. He accepted treatment with oestrogen injections 
			(chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 
			16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. 
			An inquest determined his death a suicide; his mother and some others 
			believed it was accidental. On 10 September 2009, following an Internet 
			campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official 
			public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling 
			way he was treated." The Queen granted him a posthumous pardon on 
			24 December 2013. </p>
